Missouri Vehicle Stops Report,Missouri Vehicle Stops Report,"Aggregated by the state Attorney General from (in theory) every police agency in Missouri.
Concerns raised by the citizens of Missouri and the Missouri legislature regarding allegations of bias in traffic enforcement prompted the passage of SB 1053 (2000). SB 1053 created **[Section 590.650, RSMo](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=590.650&bid=30357&hl=)**. which became effective August 28, 2000. This statute created the Vehicle Stops Report and required that the Attorney General’s Office collect and report on traffic stops conducted by law enforcement officers across the state of Missouri.
 Under § 590.650, RSMo. all peace officers in the state must report specific information, including a driver’s race, for each vehicle stop made in the state. Law enforcement agencies must provide their vehicle stops data to the Attorney General by March 1, and the Attorney General must compile the data and report to the Governor, General Assembly, and each law enforcement agency no later than June 1 of each year. The law allows the Governor to withhold state funds from any agency that does not submit its vehicle stops data to the Attorney General by the statutory deadline.

Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Incident Blotter (Archive),Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Incident Blotter (Archive),"The Police Blotter Archive contains crime incident data after it has been validated and processed to meet Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) standards, published on a nightly basis. This data validation process creates a data publishing delay of approximately thirty days. Users who require the most recent incident data should use the 30 Day Police Blotter. The 30 Day Police Blotter dataset contains more recent data, but has not yet been run through quality control and standardization procedures by the Police Bureau. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level.
This dataset only contains information reported by City of Pittsburgh Police, and does not contain incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (campus police, Port Authority, etc.)
More documentation is available in our [Crime Data Guide](http://www.wprdc.org/crime/).

Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Incident Blotter,Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Incident Blotter,"The 30-Day Police Blotter contains the most recent initial crime incident data, updated on a nightly basis. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level. The information is ""semi-refined"" meaning a police report was taken, but it has not made its way through the court system. This data is subject to change once it is processed and republished using Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) standards. The UCR coding process creates a necessary delay before processed data is available for publication. Therefore, the 30-Day blotter will provide information for users seeking the most current information available.
This dataset will be continually overwritten and any records older than thirty days will be removed. Validated incidents will be moved to the Police Blotter Archive dataset. Data in the archived file is of a higher quality and is the file most appropriate for reporting crime statistics.
This dataset only contains information reported by City of Pittsburgh Police, and does not contain incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (campus police, Port Authority, etc.)

Court Cases for Pennsylvania Aggregated - PA,,"Court case search for any court in Pennsylvania.

Recent entries made in the court filing offices may not be immediately reflected on these docket sheets. Neither the courts of the Unified Judicial System of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania nor the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts assumes any liability for inaccurate or delayed data, errors or omissions on these docket sheets. Docket sheet information should not be used in place of a criminal history background check, which can only be provided by the Pennsylvania State Police. Employers who do not comply with the provisions of the Criminal History Record Information Act (18 Pa.C.S. Section 9101 et seq.) may be subject to civil liability as set forth in 18 Pa.C.S. Section 9183.
The webpage you are viewing is operated and maintained by Pennsylvania's Unified Judicial System as a source of public information. The webpage is not affiliated with any search system for public records provided by private organizations for which fees may be incurred.
**The ability to search for and review information contained in these web docket sheets is a free public service.**
**Magisterial District Court Cases:**
On April 1, 2012, AOPC implemented a new protocol in its Magisterial District Judge System to ensure that when the official paper case records of an individual case have been or should have been destroyed in accordance with the Record Retention and Disposition Schedule with Guidelines (“Schedule”) promulgated pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 507 that the public web docket sheet for the case will no longer be accessible. These actions are consistent with the Schedule’s purpose to implement record disposition consistently throughout the UJS. Therefore, destruction of the official record pursuant to the Schedule will also result in the electronic case record information regarding the record no longer being accessible to the public.
**Philadelphia Municipal Court and Common Pleas Court Cases:**
When a search of cases from Philadelphia County is conducted using ""other criteria"", the search results will include all applicable Philadelphia Municipal Court (MC) and Court of Common Pleas (CP) cases. In Philadelphia County, MC has initial jurisdiction in processing every criminal arrest in Philadelphia and conducts misdemeanor trials and preliminary hearings for all felony cases. Therefore, some cases, such as those involving felony offenses, will initially be filed in MC but will be adjudicated in the CP. Thus, some cases will have both a MC and CP docket number that concern the same incident or offenses. To determine if a MC case has a related CP case (or vice versa), please review the ""cross court docket number"" field appearing on the web docket sheet (see page one in the case information section). Specifically, if a MC case has a corresponding CP case, the CP case docket number will most often be set forth as the ""cross court docket number"" on the web docket sheet for the MC. Similarly, if a CP case has a corresponding MC case, the MC case docket number will most often be set forth as the ""cross court docket number"" on the CP case web docket sheet.
[Click here](https://ujsportal.pacourts.us/resource/lib/CPCMSCaseLoad.pdf) to view information concerning the 'number' and 'oldest year' of cases migrated from county legacy systems to CPCMS. While not all cases were migrated, this chart will provide a general guideline as to the age of a criminal case available from the Court of Common Pleas Web Docket Sheet.

List of Data Sources for San Francisco Police Department - CA,,"Arrests, Use of Force and Stop Data, Admin Code 96A
Law Enforcement Reporting Requirements, Admin Code Sec 96A
In 2016, the City and County of San Francisco passed an ordinance establishing Administrative Code Sec. 96A, Law Enforcement Reporting Requirements. Section 96A.3 of the code includes specific requirements for how the San Francisco Police Department reports Stops, Searches, Arrests and Use of Force.

Per this requirement, reports included the following:

\- Stop Data 

Collected via the California Department of Justice Stop Data Collection System (SDCS). For purposes of reporting stop, search and associated demographic data, the report draws upon definitions provided by the state as part of AB953’s regulatory implementation.
\- Use of Force 

The total number of Uses of Force;
The total number of Uses of Force that resulted in death to the person on whom an Officer used force; and
The total number of Uses of Force broken down by race or ethnicity, age, and sex;

Fatal Police Shootings database from Washington Post,Fatal Police Shootings database from Washington Post,"In 2015, The Post began tracking details about each police-involved killing in the United States — the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the person was experiencing a mental-health crisis — by manually culling local news reports, collecting information from law enforcement websites and social media, and monitoring independent databases such as [Fatal Encounters](https://fatalencounters.org/) and the now-defunct Killed by Police project. In many cases, The Post conducts additional reporting.
In 2022, The Post updated its database to standardize and publish the names of the police agencies involved in each shooting to better measure accountability at the department level.
The 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. began a protest movement culminating in the Black Lives Matter movement and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. In this data set, The Post tracks only shootings with circumstances closely paralleling those like the killing of Brown — incidents in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths in this data set.
The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/use-of-force) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. Since 2015, The Post has documented more than twice as many fatal shootings by police as recorded by federal officials on average annually. That gap has widened in recent years, as the FBI in 2021 tracked only a third of departments’ fatal shootings.
The Post seeks to make records as comprehensive as possible; the database is updated regularly as fatal shootings are reported and as facts emerge about individual cases. At times, there may be a lag between the date of the shooting and its inclusion in the database because of delays in reporting and data verification.
To provide information about fatal police shootings since Jan. 1, 2015, send us an email at [policeshootingsfeedback@washpost.com](mailto:policeshootingsfeedback@washpost.com).

Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Firearm Seizures,Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Firearm Seizures,"This data includes counts of firearms by type seized by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. Each row describes a seizure incident involving one or more firearms.
Firearm seizures can occur for several reasons. One of the Bureau of Police justifications for seizing a firearm involves a suspicion that a firearm was used in a criminal offense. Seizures may also occur to protect officer or public safety. For example, a weapon held by someone involved in a serious medical emergency, or an unattended weapon found in a public space may be seized and held for safekeeping.
The Bureau’s firearms tracking unit conducts investigations to determine the rightful owner of firearms that have been seized. Where possible, the Bureau makes every effort to return firearms that have been seized to their rightful owners.
Firearms seized by non-City of Pittsburgh law enforcement agencies within the City of Pittsburgh may not be included in this data. Federal, State, County, and other special law enforcement agencies (e.g. campus, transit, hospital, etc.) operate within the City limits.
Data collected through supplemental reports filled out by Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers upon taking possession of a firearm.
Locations where the seizure occurred are anonymized to the address block or nearest intersection. It's not always possible to geocode these anonymized addresses. In cases where geocoding fails, the latitude and longitude fields are left empty. These will display as ""None"" in table views on the WPRDC site.
Exact date and report numbers have been removed to protect the privacy of individuals and any active investigations.

Orange County Sheriff SB 1421 records releases,Orange County Sheriff SB 1421 records releases,"Amendments to Penal Code section 832.7 require the release of law enforcement records relating to officer-involved shootings, uses of force resulting in death or great bodily injury and sustained findings against peace officers of dishonesty or sexual assault, as defined by the law. Such records had previously been exempt from public disclosure.
All records released must be thoroughly reviewed to ensure legally protected personal information of victims, witnesses, the accused, law enforcement and other involved parties are redacted. Investigators, human resources staff, county counsel, and records personnel separately review each record. This painstaking process ensures all responsive information and details are disclosed.
Redactions were made to the responsive records as follows:
- Home addresses, personal phone numbers, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers (Penal Code 832.7(b)(5)(A))
- Names of victims and witnesses (Penal Code 832.7(b)(5)(B))
- Current undercover officers because disclosure of their identifies would compromise their safety and pending investigations (Penal Code 832.7(b)(5)(D); 832.7(b)(6))
- Juvenile names (Welfare and Institutions Code 827; Penal Code 832.7(b)(5)(B))
- Personal information about an individual who was the subject of a use of force (Penal Code 832.7(b)(5)(C))
We have also blurred images on the video recordings of the following:
- The faces of victims and witnesses (Penal Code 832.7(b)(5)(B))
- The private body parts of inmates (Penal Code 832.7(b)(5)(C))
We have withheld the audio recording of an interview with the victim of a sexual assault as defined by SB 1421 (Government Code 7923.750(a)).

Calls for Service for Seattle Police Department - WA,,"This data represents police response activity. Each row is a record of a Call for Service (CfS) logged with the Seattle Police Department (SPD) Communications Center. Calls originated from the community and range from in progress or active emergencies to requests for problem solving. Additionally, officers will log calls from their observations of the field.

Previous versions of this data set have withheld approximately 40% of calls. This updated process will release more than 95% of all calls but we will no longer provide latitude and longitude specific location data. In an effort to safeguard the privacy of our community, calls will only be located to the “beat” level. Beats are the most granular unit of management used for patrol deployment. To learn more about patrol deployment, please visit: <https://www.seattle.gov/police/about-us/about-policing/precinct-and-patrol-boundaries>
